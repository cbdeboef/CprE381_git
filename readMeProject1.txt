This is the beginning of project 1 for CprE381. This project revolves around the idea of programming a MIPS single cycle processor to use the following commands:

	add
	addi
	addiu
	addu
	and
	andi
	lui
	lw
	not
	nor
	xor
	xori
	or
	ori
	slt
	slti
	sll
	srl
	sra
	sw
	sub
	beq
	bne
	j
	jal
	jr
	repl.qb (see mips DPS extention documentation)

This will be done almost exclusivly in vhdl and tested using modelsim.
